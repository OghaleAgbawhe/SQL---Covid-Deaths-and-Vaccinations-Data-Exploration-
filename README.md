# SQL---Covid-Deaths-and-Vaccinations-Data-Exploration-

Introduction
This project involves the exploration and analysis of COVID-19 data. It includes SQL queries used to analyze COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination data across different locations and time periods. The project aims to gain insights into fatality rates, infection rates, and vaccination progress at a global and regional level.

SQL Queries
The project utilizes SQL queries to investigate various aspects of the COVID-19 data. Here's a summary of the key queries used in this exploration:
Exploring Total Cases vs Total Deaths
Fatality Rate in Specific Countries
Infection Rate in Specific Countries
Countries with Highest Infection Rate Compared to Population
Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
Continents with Highest Death Count per Population
Global COVID-19 Numbers
Exploring Total Population vs Vaccinations

**Data manipulation and management strategies utilized**
In this project, various data manipulation and management strategies were employed to handle data aggregation, calculations, and data storage efficiently. The following techniques were utilized:
Common Table Expression (CTE)
Temporary Table
Creating View for Data Storage
